    <!--Application Overview-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Application Overview</h1>
    <p>Website that generates a random password based on input and time of day. Inputs will use parameters such as using at least one <br>
        capital letter or a digit. It will also make use of a database full of phrases that can be mixed around in the generated password <br>
        as phrases are known to be much stronger when creating a password instead of random letters or numbers. Users will be able to create<br>
        an account on our website with a username and password, and the generation of passwords should be unique for every user so that an <br>
        adversary can't use this website to just generate passwords that someone coudl've gotten from this website and brute force their way<br>
        into any accounts they have set up with anybody else. This would be a big problem, and it's important that such a thing will never<br>
        happen in order to protect our users and make them feel confident in our product.</p>

    <!--TEAM NOTES: Just need to type your ideas in the paragraph tags and it should be good-->
    <!--Technology Overview-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Technology Overview</h1>
    <p>This site will utilize a variation of the MEAN stack which includes MongoDB for document database management, Node.js, <br> 
        Express, and HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (over Angular) on the client-side. Microsoft Azure is the cloud <br>
        computing service that will be employed for hosting and the project will be managed on GitHub with Git Version Control. 
    </p>

    <!--Feature List-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Feature List</h1>
    <List>
        <ul>Simple user interface with various options</ul>
        <ul>Allow's restrictions and parameters like Length or minimum required amount of numbers or special characters</ul>
        <ul>different passwords generated from the same inputs at different times</ul>
        <ul>database used to pull from when creating the password</ul>
        <ul>server side algorithm that uses user input on a private variable to create a password</ul>
    </List>

    <!--Future Feature List-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Future Feature List</h1>
    <p>Future features will potentially include saving passwords with an ecryption key generator. 
        <br>Each user will be given an id and a key to reconstruct their passwords instead of saving them server side.
    </p>

    <!--Basic Technical Features-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Basic Technical Features</h1>
    <p>Technical features that will be implemented which fall within the scope of class activities include designing an <br>
        appealing user interface through front-end web programming with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, <br>
        the deployment of this application to the web through Microsoft Azure, as <br> well as server-side functionality with Node.js. 
    </p>

    <!--Advanced Technical Features-->
    <h1 id="basicHeader">Advanced Technical Features</h1>
    <p>Advanced technical features that will be implemented to exceed the scope of class content include<br> 
        user authentication and data collection via MongoDB database management.
